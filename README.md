# Polynomial-Regression
Polynomial regression, describe the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y using an nth-degree polynomial in x. However, in polynomial regression, we allow for a curve to best fit the data. This can be particularly useful when the relationship between the variables is not linear.

This method allows capturing more complex patterns in the data compared to traditional linear regression.

# Problem Statement
This dataset contains information on insurance charges along with various demographic and lifestyle factors of individuals. The dataset aims to explore the relationship between these factors and insurance expenses using polynomial regression.

The dataset encompasses essential demographic and lifestyle attributes of insured individuals alongside their respective insurance expenses.

# Variables
# Independent variables-

1.age: Continuous variable representing the age of the insured individual.

2.sex: Categorical variable indicating the gender of the insured individual.

3.bmi: Continuous variable representing the body mass index of the insured individual.

4.children: Discrete variable representing the number of children or dependents covered by the insurance.

5.smoker: Binary variable indicating whether the insured individual is a smoker or not.

6.region: Categorical variable representing the residential area of the insured individual.

# Dependent variable-

expenses: Continuous variable representing the insurance charges incurred by the individual.

# Dataset
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle].
